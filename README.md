Happy Birthday (at Midnight) - A Facebook App
=================================================

I for one am way too lazy to actually stay up till 12, or more likely, I forget what I am doing at by the time it reaches 12 I am playing a video game or something, not focused on their birthday and miss the 12:00 A.M. magic moment. This app solves that problem. It runs on the Google App Engine as I am soo cheap to pay for hosting. It's simple and the time that I posted it to GitHub it has been about 50 hours since I had the idea. It's very rough, and probably won't get much more development. Unless it goes well on Facebook.

### Bugs, And Such
Yeah, it probably has about 1500 bugs, that's fine. If you want to fix one, go for it. Fork it, Push it, I'll merge it and we'll have a pretty little project.
